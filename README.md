# MarioMaker

This week, we focused on learning the Command pattern and DLLs. I carefully followed lecture four, took notes, and experimented with both Unity and Unreal. On the quiz, I performed better than in previous weeks by slowing down and reading questions carefully.

I found the Command pattern straightforward, especially since I had used it before in a developer console for a GDW project. In this activity, I applied it to this project, a Mario Maker style editor. The user interact with a grid of buttons, and each button press executes a command. All the users performed commands are stored in a stack to allow undo functionality.

While I wasnâ€™t able to successfully compile a DLL during class, I followed the lecture steps closely and, with permission, I implemented an alternative file-based save/load system. The grid state is written to and read from a .txt file. At home, I later completed the command pattern implementation fully.
